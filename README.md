# IBM_Data_Science

During the period of COVID-19 pandemic, I have explored one of my favourite concepts i.e,. Data Science.

This is a professional certification course offered by Coursera. This course is started with an introduction to Data Science course, then it provided some knowledge about the tools for Data Science. 

Next comes the methodologies of Data Science. We know that Python is one of the most suitable languages for Data Science, So the course has provided the knowledge of Python that is required for Data Science. Then comes the course which provides knowledge about the Databases and SQL needed for Data Science. Next comes the analysis of the data with python. In this course I mainly learnt python, Data Science fundamentals and the theory subject related to analysis, which is required for a Data Science related project.
